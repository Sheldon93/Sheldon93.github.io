Hello! I am Sheldon McClish, I would like to welcome you to my official webpage.

As of this writing (December 18, 2018), I am just now creating this page. I am looking for work in the IT industry, ready to move on from working in the restaurant industry while still continually going to school. I am skilled in programming, Linux, Mac OS, Windows, networking, IT fundamentals and troubleshooting along with many other things. I have an Associate's in Computer Science and am currently working to finish my Bachelor's degree in CyberSecurity. Please contact me for questions or recruitment for employment.

As I continue to update this page, I will update my credentials as well. I am looking for work in the IT industry.
