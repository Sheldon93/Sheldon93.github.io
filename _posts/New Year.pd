I am proud to say that I am offically graduated from Metropolitan Community College - Kansas City (which includes Longview, Penn Valley,
and every school that I've attended classes within the MCCKC area. My plan was to officially enroll in the University of Central Missouri's 
Cybersecurity Bachelor's degree program by this time, but I have chosen to hold that off until the fall of this year while instead pursuing my
CCNA certificate enrolled in MCC's CCENT/CCNA Program so that I can obtain my Cisco Certified Network Associate license and be able
to get some experience in the Networking aspect of IT (possibly applying for a Network Admin/Engineer position). I enjoy Linux so much
that I've applied for a Linux Systems Adminstrator job in the meantime to see what holds out for me. If I get the position, I may just stick
with Linux since it's become such an integral part of the IT industry and the fact that I've become so attracted to it. If not, then
I will continue to focus more on sending out network applications and continue my Linux education while pursuing my degree in Cybersecurity.
